speech1;Event is successful;;;x
speech2;Event doesn't go as planned;;;x
EVTDESCroyspeech.0;You gather all the lords of your realm to the Assembly Chamber in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Together, you have many discussions and disagreements about what event to hold in the Assembly Chamber in the coming days, but ultimately the choice is yours.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.0;Arrange a Holy Speech;;;x
EVTOPTBroyspeech.0;Organize a Military Parade;;;x
EVTOPTCroyspeech.0;Define State Policy;;;x
EVTOPTDroyspeech.0;Rail Against Foreigners;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.1;Your speech is a rousing success! Many people from all corners of your realm gathered in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s Assembly Chamber to hear you speak of your undying devotion to [Root.Religion.GetName]. The masses were impressed by your prayers, some even fainting in the stands. Soon, word of this event will spread across the entire realm!;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.1;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] be praised!;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.2;Your speech did not go as planned. Barely anyone showed up, and the guests that did arrive were unattentive during your speech, even laughing and talking over you.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.2;I'm so embarrassed!;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.3;Your Military Parade is a success! You start the day with a Parade March that precedes all around [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. Then, you address the troops in the Assembly Chamber before handing out rewards at a pre-planned ceremony. The peasants greatly admired the spectacle and there is now no shortage of men willing to serve the crown.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.3;To Victory!;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.4;You managed to botch the Military Parade spectacularly. Nearly every event was behind schedule, men deserted, believing they were on their way to fight, and some even turned up to the Assembly Chamber drunk and causing havoc. In the end, the event had to be cancelled prematurely.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.4;This is all my fault...;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.5;Your speech was a success! You were able to clearly and reasonably define your expectations from your vassals and people. Most, you feel, are on the same page as you while many more could not deny your oratory skill.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.5;United We Stand!;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.6;Your speech on realm policy was a failure. Your vassals showed up late, complaining about the need to travel to the capital in such weather. When it was time for you to speak, many showed little interest, few even left. You left the Assembly Chamber feeling defeated.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.6;Maybe this was a mistake...;;;x

EVTTITroyspeech.7;Make [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] Great Again;;;x
EVTDESCroyspeech.7;Your speech was a success! People from all around the realm gathered to hear you rail against the vile foreign entities working against the people's interest. Emotions ran high, but at least the peasants now have another object to take out their frustrations on.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.7;All is well now.;;;x

EVTDESCroyspeech.8;Your speech did not go as planned. You tried to get the people in attendance to understand that minorities are the cause of their strife, but it seems they did not take you too seriously.;;;x
EVTOPTAroyspeech.8;Damn it...;;;x
