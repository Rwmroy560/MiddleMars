#BM_MIDDLE_MARS_ERA_INFO;This can currently only be used with the Random World setting which requires the Holy Fury DLC, or with the provided save file. Trying to launch the mod without using the Random World setting or save file will crash the game.\nReligion, culture, and de jure locations have been manually set, so it is ironically recommended to use all historical settings possible within Random World. Random world is a work-around until events can be made compatible.\n\nRecommended settings for Random World:\nAll settings set to Historical, except culture names set to random\nDefault title names\nAll boxes checked except 'More Pagans';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MIDDLE_MARS_ERA_INFO;Long ago, many centuries after Mars had been fully Terraformed, Earth went dark on the same day all existing electronics on Mars stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky.\n\nMars quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured.\n\nAround 1000 years later humanity is recovering and has entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster. No one knows if Earth is still around and is thought of as more of a holy icon and legend. Some ideologies reject the concept or existence of Earth as we know it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ERA_CHAR_NAME_102265;Choose Custom Game Setup followed by Random World instead, or the provided save file. The save file would need to be moved from the mod directory to the save directory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_102265;Maximilianos of Olympus Mons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_102265;The Hellenic Kingdom of Mount Olympus is on it's way to unification, but sees nations of similar size creeping in from fellow Hellenics in Gigas Sulci, Singularists in Olympica Fossae, Zunists in Tharsis Montes, and the Divine Cycle on the Daedalian Planum.\n\nBeyond Tharsis Mons and the Daedalian Planum are Altered agents plotting entry into the western regions, and nomads squabiling among themselves, though who could potentially became an unstopable threat if they were ever managed to be united.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_111585;Abdul-Aziz of Noachis Terra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_111585;Westen Argyre, a longtime staple of the Blessed Singularity Valles Marineris Empire, has been conquered by the almightly Terraformed who sailed across the Argyrian Sea from Noachis Terra.\n\nNow controlling nearly the entire Argyrian Sea, Abdul-Aziz sets his sights north toward Valles Marineris to finish off the troublesome Empire once and for all.\nTo the west of West Argyre are scattered pagan tribals, and a pagan kingdom keep within Solis Planum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_104895;Alvar of Valles Marineris;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_104895;Westen Argyre, a longtime staple of the Blessed Singularity Valles Marineris Empire, has been conquered by the treacherous Terraformed who sailed across the Argyrian Sea from Noachis Terra.\n\nThe Empire stands in shambles, having also ceded their north-eastern territory in an independence revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_100785;John of West Alba;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_100785;Holy Terra, the remnants of modern day Catholics, prepare for the first crusade since before the disaster. The Kingdom of South Alba seems well poised to benefit from this crusade, however, is in a constant state of flux with their Orthodox neighbor, the King of North Alba. Both kingdoms remain unstable due to the rulers not being the same culture as their vassals.\nNearby are the heathenous regions of Tempe Terra, home to Germanic Warlords, Olympus Mons, realm of the Hellenic Kingdoms, and Tharsis Montes, where savages will tie you up and leave you to be judged by the sun. Beyond Tharsis Montes are nomads squabiling among themselves, though who could potentially become an unstopable threat if ever united.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_111905;Elupuyan of Promethei Terra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_111905;A fleet of ships from a nearby star system has arrived to investigate in the wake of the disaster. Because light travel is impossible it took this intersystem ship 1066 years to reach its destination in the Solar System.\n Due to unforseen circumstances, the crew is less prepared than would be viable to complete their mission.  They must trade their advanced tech and knowledge, seen as magic by the majority of Martians, for food and resources in order to survive. They have set up base in the Planum Australe Region near the South Pole, and Promethei Terra on the Shores of the diverse Hellas Sea, settling their people into former nomad territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
