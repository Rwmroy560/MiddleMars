EVTDESCbuy_mech.1;You have purchased a piloting license and are now authorized to pilot a Combat Mech Suit. Be careful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTbuy_mech.1;This is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbuy_mech.2;You have commisioned your Spymaster with the task of finding and purchasing a Combat Mech Suit for your own personal use. There are many Zhao Rangers on the market, and for the right price you have acquired one for yourself. You anxiously await its delivery to you at the gates of [Root.Capital.GetName], but even still as it arrives you can't help but almost faint. Two stories tall, wide, golden, with claws the size of an ox and creaking ungodly noises from its orifices, your Zhao Ranger Mech Suit is as fearsome as you had hoped it would look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTbuy_mech.2;I will dominate the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITsuit_events.0;Mind and Body;;;x
EVTDESCsuit_events; With each engagement you get better and better at fighting inside your Mech suit. However, Piloting an Armored Mech Suit is heavily taxing on the human body. Due to having to connect to the pilot's spine every use, over time the Mech Suit can kill its pilot.;;;x
